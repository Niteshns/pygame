# Report for Assignment 1

## Project chosen

Name: pygame

URL: https://github.com/pygame/pygame

We used lizard in the terminal to count the number of lines of code (NLOC). NLOC: 113408. From these NLOC, ~48992 were in Python as 43% of this project consists of Python.

Programming language: Python

## Coverage measurement

### Existing tool

We used the tool Coverage.py.
Steps we took to do the test:
1. Enter the repository path in terminal.
2. Inside the repository directory, we went to path "/test" by using `cd test`.
3. Execute the coverage tool on the inbuild unit tester with the command: `coverage run .`.
4. After execution, the command `coverage report` is ran to get the coverage test results which will be shown below.

## Screenshot of coverage results:

<Function 2 name>

<Provide the same kind of information provided for Function 1>

## Coverage improvement

### Individual tests

<The following is supposed to be repeated for each group member>

<Group member name>

<Test 1>

<Show a patch (diff) or a link to a commit made in your forked repository that shows the new/enhanced test>

<Provide a screenshot of the old coverage results (the same as you already showed above)>

<Provide a screenshot of the new coverage results>

<State the coverage improvement with a number and elaborate on why the coverage is improved>

<Test 2>

<Provide the same kind of information provided for Test 1>

### Overall

<Provide a screenshot of the old coverage results by running an existing tool (the same as you already showed above)>

<Provide a screenshot of the new coverage results by running the existing tool using all test modifications made by the group>

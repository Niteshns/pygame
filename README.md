# Report for Assignment 1

## Project chosen

Name: beets

URL: https://github.com/beetbox/beets.git

We used lizard in VScode to count the lines of code. The number of lines was: 113408(In Python 48992 lines because 43% of the project is Python).

Programming language: Python

## Coverage measurement

### Existing tool

We used the tool Coverage.py.
Steps we took to do the test:
1. Enter the repository path in vscode.
2. Inside the repository, we went to path "/test".
3. We then executed the coverage tool on the inbuild unit tester with the command: "coverage run .".
4. After the testing, we ran the command: "coverage report" to get the coverage test results.

### Your own coverage tool

<The following is supposed to be repeated for each group member>

<Group member name>

<Function 1 name>

<Show a patch (diff) or a link to a commit made in your forked repository that shows the instrumented code to gather coverage measurements>

<Provide a screenshot of the coverage results output by the instrumentation>

<Function 2 name>

<Provide the same kind of information provided for Function 1>

## Coverage improvement

### Individual tests

<The following is supposed to be repeated for each group member>

<Group member name>

<Test 1>

<Show a patch (diff) or a link to a commit made in your forked repository that shows the new/enhanced test>

<Provide a screenshot of the old coverage results (the same as you already showed above)>

<Provide a screenshot of the new coverage results>

<State the coverage improvement with a number and elaborate on why the coverage is improved>

<Test 2>

<Provide the same kind of information provided for Test 1>

### Overall

<Provide a screenshot of the old coverage results by running an existing tool (the same as you already showed above)>

<Provide a screenshot of the new coverage results by running the existing tool using all test modifications made by the group>

## Statement of individual contributions

<Write what each group member did>
